# MachineLearningWebSec
My practice about web security and machine learning.

## Description

I am always having an ambition that is to combine machine learning and security. Although I am aware the industry has studied it for a long time and even some of companies have deployed such kind of products, it is still not too late for me to learn.

Here are some scripts or tiny demos I wrote to help me have deeper understaining of the knowledge. 

## Achievement

* KNN to detect evil system commands.

## For Details

I will post some details about the scripts on my personal blog- [http://www.zhzzhz.com](http://www.zhzzhz.com). You are very welcome to share your points with me if you have any ideas for my codes.

## Thanks
